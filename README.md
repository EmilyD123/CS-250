Software Development Lifecycle


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by identifying the role they are playing when interfacing with the software, the feature they would like to see or use, and the goal that feature is suppose to fulfill. Creating user stories helps me clearly define these elements as well as extrapolate the acceptance criteria for that increment of software.
   
   
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Learning agile methodology has actually change the way I view program development. I once saw programming as a linear process with roles isolated in their scope of contribution. I now approach program development as a dynamic, iterative, and collaborative process. I hope to incorporate many aspects of agile in the future, from user stories, to sprint planning, to retrospectives. I think some of the estimaiton processes I've learned, such as assigning story points and burn down charts, will be very useful to future projects. But most importantly, I hope to incorporate some of the over-arching agile principles that fuel this framework, such as: prioritization of customer experience, continuous improvement through reflection and learning, iteration, experimentation, technical excellence, and change is always welcome!
   
   
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

There are a few factors which are equally required to positively contribute to a team. First, you have to show up. A team member who is absent or frequently tardy in regards to meetings, deadlines, and assignments is going to inhibit the capacity for the rest of the team to do their work. A good team member is feedback-positive. They actively solicit feedback on their work and ideas, recieve that feedback in a gracious manner, as well as provide constructive feedback for others when it is within their scope to do so. To expand on this, it is important to mention the necessity of well developed communication skills. Team members should understand the proper channels of communication, when each is necessary, and who should be included in the correspondence. A good team member is comfortable working alone as well as with others, and has a solid understanding of their scope of expertise that they work within. Finally, a good team member is committed to learning and growing, both for their own professional development and that of their teammates.
